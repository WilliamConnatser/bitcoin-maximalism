            The term Bitcoin Maximalism was initially termed by Vitalik Buterin in a
            <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects/" class="regular-link uppercase">blog</a>
            post written on November 19, 2014, and has since been popularized throughout the cryptocurrency community
            to describe ardent Bitcoin supporters. Bitcoin Maximalism was originally coined as a sort of derogatory
            name for staunch Bitcoin proponents, but some Bitcoin proponents have ironically adopted the Bitcoin
            Maximalist title as a badge of honor! There are many immensly nuanced arguments for and against Bitcoin
            Maximalism, and BitcoinMaximalism.com is intended to serve as an objective*** overview of Bitcoin

            YOLO is an advocate of users doing their own research by informing oneself through many of the
            independent resources that are freely available. The Site is not meant to be a definitive guide, but
            instead an introductory outline of some of the nuances surrounding Bitcoin Maximalism and
            cryptocurrencies in general. Don't blindly trust The Site, The Site's users' opinions, or blindly
            trust any of the information contained within and linked from the Site, but instead verify the

            <h2>Forward-Looking Statements</h2>
            www.BitcoinMaximalism.com is an Informational Site that contains subjective, speculative and
            forward-looking statements which may or may not be based on historical facts. This provision is
            intended to provide the neccessary, meaningful and cautionary statements identifying important factors
            which could cause any forward-looking statements contained within the Site to be untrue, but at the
            same time this is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all risk factors. Any forward-looking
            statements contained within the Site do not neccessarily represent the beliefs of YOLO or its
            affiliates, but are instead meant to be a cursory outline of beliefs that YOLO has deduced are
            generally believed to be true, both by Bitcoin Maximalism protagonists and antagonists.

            The information contained in this document may include, or incorporate by reference, forward-looking
            statements, which would include any statements that are not statements of historical fact. These
            forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by
            known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, most of which are beyond YOLO's control.
            Investors should conduct independent due diligence, with assistance from professional financial, legal
            and tax experts, on all cryptocurrencies discussed on the Site, and develop a stand-alone judgment of

            in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and
            binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator
            and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by
            the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final,
            and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or
            equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the

            OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and YOLO agree
            otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise

            ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SITE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
            OTHERWISE, EVEN IF YOLO International LLC OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
            OF DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR

            <h2>Termination/Access Restriction</h2>
            YOLO reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site and the related
            services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
            this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas and you hereby consent to the exclusive
            jurisdiction and venue of courts in Texas in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the
            Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions
            of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section.
        </p>

        <p>
            You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and
            YOLO as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. YOLO's performance of this agreement is subject
            to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of YOLO's
            right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your
            use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by YOLO with respect to such use. If any part of
            this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but
            not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or
            unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
            matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in
            effect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and
            YOLO with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and
            proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and YOLO with respect to the Site. A
            printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in
            judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and
            subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and
            maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that this agreement and all related
            documents be written in English.

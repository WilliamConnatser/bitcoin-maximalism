      An Objective* Overview of Bitcoin Maximalism
    </h1>

    <br />

    <div id="bitcoin-maximalism">
      The term Bitcoin Maximalism was initially termed by Vitalik Buterin in a <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects/">blog</a>
      post written on November 19, 2014, and has since been popularized throughout the cryptocurrency community
      to describe ardent Bitcoin supporters. Bitcoin Maximalism was originally coined as a sort of derogatory name for
      staunch Bitcoin proponents, but some Bitcoin proponents have ironically adopted the Bitcoin Maximalist title as a
      badge of honor! There are many immensly nuanced arguments for and against Bitcoin Maximalism. The arguments
      outlined here are only meant to give you an unbiased introduction to the nuance surrounding them, so please do
      your own research because there is a lot more to learn beyond what's written in the slides and resources contained
      within.

Mining is the process which Bitcoin uses to come to an agreement on the history of its "Blockchain". A Blockchain is an append-only ledger that maintains a record of all previous Bitcoin transactions in a decentralized manner. Mining is also leveraged as a method to distribute new Bitcoins into the ecosystem through "Block Rewards". Bitcoin miners expend copious amounts of computational power in hopes of being the first to solve a never-ending series of cryptographic puzzles by the brute force guessing of their answers. Each block (or series) is algorithmically designed to occur every ten minutes on average, and a new puzzle is created the moment the last puzzle\'s solution is found. The miner with the most computational power is the most likely to solve each block\'s puzzle, and as a result is also the most likely to secure that block\'s Block Reward. The Block Reward is a slowly diminishing reward for solving each block\'s puzzle.',

Bitcoin proponents argue that it is likely Bitcoin will gain the amount of usage necessary for it to eventually become a deflationary currency. Bitcoin\'s future security depends on the increase of its usage over the course of the next 120 years. Theoretically, assuming a sufficient amount of transaction fees can be collected by miners, it will no longer be necessary to subsidize Bitcoin\'s security with inflationary block rewards after an arbitrary point in time. Eventually, the only source of income for miners will be what they can garner from including transactions in blocks, and therefore earning the associated transaction fees. Bitcoin can also serve as a settlement layer for "Extra Layers" and "Sidechains", which will increase the amount of fees collected by miners due to the added utility and throughput.',

This paradigm has been made even worse in recent times, because the free market has given these alternative cryptocurrencies a decent amount of value, and therefore it provides incentive for bad actors to create an endless amount of them. If these inflationary ALT coins are taken seriously, then that will harm the argument that Bitcoin is sound money, or that any other cryptocurrency could ever be considered sound money in the future, because the overall cryptocurrency supply cap can be continuously to be debased forever. Thousands of alternative cryptocurrency "pump and dump" scams have come and gone during Bitcoin\'s short history. After experiencing a thousand too many of them, some Bitcoin Maximalists consider anyone participating in alternative cryptocurrencies by developing, speculating in, or promoting them to be scammers, because it is impossible to tell if someone\'s a scammer, or just simply ignorant to the fact their token has little chance of being successful and garnering value in the longrun.',

As long as a majority of the computational power remain honest, then the rules of the protocol must be unbiasedly enforced by all network participants, or else they will create what\'s been termed a fork (aka. a completely different cryptocurrency with a different blockchain). A lot of alternative cryptocurrencies make tradeoffs in order to "improve" upon Bitcoin\'s perceived shortcomings (which tend to be highly debatable.) Decentralization is one of the more common tradeoffs that are made. The tradeoffs are usually made in a few ways, such as: a more centralized Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, less computational power being consumed by a large order of magnitude using the same algorithm, or the non-existence of specialized hardware made specifically for mining an alternative consensus algorithm (GPUs and CPUs can be re-purposed which ultimately makes the cost of an attack cheaper, and bot nets can control large amounts of computational power cheaply.)',

Since most people that are into cryptocurrencies own at least some Bitcoin, that makes its network more valuable due to the ability to communicate and exchange freely with more people.

Up until that point, their had been a faction of community members that had repeatedly mounted unsuccessful attempts at hard forking the Bitcoin protocol in order to scale a different way. Those siding against Segwit mostly believed that raising the block size was the fastest (and easiest) way to scale Bitcoin, that Segwit was an unnecessary complication of the Bitcoin protocol, and some even claimed that the "anyone can spend" addresses that Segwit introduced made Bitcoin more vulnerable to 51% attacks.
